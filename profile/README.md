We build AI systems that work with people, not against them.

#### What We Do

We help ethical SMBs leverage LLMs without the corporate nonsense. No job replacement theater, just practical tools that amplify what teams already do well. Deep in the trenches with RAG systems, vector search, and making AI actually useful for solving real problems. Our goal is to make complexity look simple.

#### How We Think

AI should be a tool, not a replacement. We build systems that respect the humans using them. Transparency matters. Process matters. And often the best solution is the boring one that just works.

#### Got a Problem?

Messy data? Wondering if LLMs can help without breaking everything? Let's talk.
